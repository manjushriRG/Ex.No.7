Navigation links: Home, Plan Trip, Explore Destinations, Saved Trips, About, Contact

Login / Sign Up buttons

🏖️ 2. Hero Section

Large background image or video of travel destinations

Headline: “Plan Your Perfect Trip — From Dream to Departure”

Search bar: “Where do you want to go?” + date pickers + traveler count

Call-to-action button: “Start Planning”

📅 3. Trip Planning Workflow (Main Feature)

Step 1: Choose Destination (search by city/country or discover via recommendations)

Step 2: Set Travel Dates and Duration

Step 3: Add Accommodation (Hotels, Airbnbs, etc.)

Step 4: Add Transportation (Flights, Car Rentals, Trains)

Step 5: Add Activities & Attractions (browse local tours, experiences, restaurants)

Step 6: Budget Estimator (auto-calculates estimated total cost)

Step 7: Review & Save Itinerary (with export to PDF or shareable link)

🗺️ 4. Interactive Itinerary Map

Integrate a map showing daily routes, destinations, and major stops

Option to rearrange days via drag-and-drop

💡 5. Suggested Destinations Section

Cards with trending destinations, top-rated spots, and travel tips

Filter by season, budget, or interest (beach, adventure, culture, etc.)

💬 6. User Reviews & Community

Section showing traveler stories or sample itineraries

Rating and comment system

👤 7. User Dashboard

Saved trips overview

Download, edit, or duplicate itineraries

Profile management and travel preferences

📩 8. Newsletter Signup

Simple form with incentives like “Get weekly travel inspiration”

🦶 9. Footer

Quick links (FAQs, Support, Privacy Policy, Terms)

Social media icons

Contact info

🎨 Design & Technical Guidelines

Responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)

Clean, modern UI (use colors inspired by travel — sky blue, sand, green)

Use icons for each trip step

Include subtle animations and hover effects

Consider integration with APIs (Google Maps, Skyscanner, Booking.com)

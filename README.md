Call-to-action button: “Start Planning”

📅 3. Trip Planning Workflow (Main Feature)

Step 1: Choose Destination (search by city/country or discover via recommendations)

Step 2: Set Travel Dates and Duration

Step 3: Add Accommodation (Hotels, Airbnbs, etc.)

Step 4: Add Transportation (Flights, Car Rentals, Trains)

Step 5: Add Activities & Attractions (browse local tours, experiences, restaurants)

Step 6: Budget Estimator (auto-calculates estimated total cost)

Step 7: Review & Save Itinerary (with export to PDF or shareable link)

🗺️ 4. Interactive Itinerary Map

Integrate a map showing daily routes, destinations, and major stops

Option to rearrange days via drag-and-drop

💡 5. Suggested Destinations Section

Cards with trending destinations, top-rated spots, and travel tips

Filter by season, budget, or interest (beach, adventure, culture, etc.)

💬 6. User Reviews & Community

Section showing traveler stories or sample itineraries

Rating and comment system

👤 7. User Dashboard

Saved trips overview

Download, edit, or duplicate itineraries

Profile management and travel preferences

📩 8. Newsletter Signup

Simple form with incentives like “Get weekly travel inspiration”

🦶 9. Footer

Quick links (FAQs, Support, Privacy Policy, Terms)

Social media icons

Contact info

🎨 Design & Technical Guidelines

Responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)

Clean, modern UI (use colors inspired by travel — sky blue, sand, green)

Use icons for each trip step

Include subtle animations and hover effects

Consider integration with APIs (Google Maps, Skyscanner, Booking.com)

# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:
 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.
 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.
 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.
 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
